// Please Note: The implemented code is based off of pseudocode provided by the Professor in the assignment PDF
// There is also high level pseudocode collaboration with my sister Twisha Sharma (tvsharm)
// Eugene is cited throughout the asgn for his explanation during his lab section on 02_18_2022.
// Eugene explained how to set up the assignment for huffman coding as well as explained how to properly begin
// each step of the assignment.
// Audrey is cited for her tutoring session on 02_25_2022 when she helped look over my huffman.c and node.c.
// Audrey also helped me fix syntax error in stack.c during her tutoring session on 03_02_2022
// She specifically helped me with stack_pop()
// Ben is cited for helping me with read_bytes and write_bytes during his tutoring session on 03_01_2022
// During his tutoring session he explained how to best implement read_bytes. Ben also looked over my code.c
// Brian is cited for his section on 02_28_2022 when he helped look over my pq.c
// Brian helped to also explain how to proceed with code.c and the best way to go about implementing the functions
// Brian also helped me during his tutoring session on 03_02_2022 by looking over my io.c file and helping me
// fix compilation and syntax errors
